# super-tic-tac-toe
Super Tic-Tac-Toe is a game.

## Rules

1. First player gets to choose any of the squares.
2. The next player must play in the board whose location corresponds to the square chosen in the previous move.
3. Play continues until someone gets three in a row. If a player does, the entire board is marked for that player.
4. If a player is forced to play in a game that has already been won, they instead get to choose any game to play in.
5. Play continues until a player wins three boards that are in a row.
6. If a small game draws, it remains un-earned (neither an X nor an O is placed over it). If the entire game ends with a draw, one tie-breaker option is to give the win to the player who won the most small games.
